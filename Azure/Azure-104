Azure Storage:
- Durable and highly available
- Secure
- Scalable
- Managed
- Accessible

Types of Storage:
Structured Data:
Unstructured Data:
Storage for virtual machine:
										Blob Storage 	- Blob Containers	- Blobs
										File Service 	- File Service		- Files And Folders
Azure Subscription - Storage Accounts									
										Table Storage 	- Tables			- Entities
										Queue Storage	- Queues			- Messages

- Azure uses three tier architecture:
Front end layer
Partition Layer
Stream layer



All storage accounts are encrypted using storage service encryption.

Storage Account Types:
-----------------------

1. Standard: Backed by HDD and lowest cost per GB.
2. Premium: Backed by SSD and offer low latency.
Cannot convert standard to premium or vice versa.


Blob Storage:
-------------
- Binary Lodge Object Storage
- Accessed via HTTP/HTTPS protocol.
- Stored unstructured data such as image,distributed access, video, audio...etc.

i. Blocks blobs: composed of blocks and are ideal for storing text or binary files.

ii. Append blobs: optimized for append operations and are ideal for storing loggng data from VMs.

iii. Page blobs: Made up of 512 byte pages up to 8TB, and designed for frequent read/write operations. foundation of AZ IAAS disks and ideal for storing OS and Data disks.
					

File Service:
--------------

- Offers file share in cloud and accessible via SMB protocol.


Table Storage:
--------------
- Used for structured data.
- Accessed using OData protocol, LINQ queries, WCF data service, .net libraries.


Azure Storage Queue:
---------------------
- Used to store large number of messages that can be accessed anywhere via authenticated calls using HTTP and HTTPS.

- 250 storage account, each 5PiB.
