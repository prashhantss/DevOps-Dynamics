ANSIBLE:
- Configuration management tool also can be used as deployment tool if required
- Provided by redhat.
- Configuration can be any task which we can execute on the server. It can be
	1. Creating users/groups.
	2. Installing software/package.
	3. Creating/updating /copying files.
	4. Start/Stop Services
	
CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT TOOLS :
	- Push Based: Ansible, SaltStack
	- Pull Based: Chef, Puppet

ANSIBLE FEATURES:

- Configure machines in an agent-less manner using ssh.
- Built on Python and hence provide a lof of pythons - functionality.
- YMAL based Playbooks
- Used SSH for secure connections.
- Follows Push based architecture.

ANSIBLE ARCHITECTURE:
- Ansible
- Playbooks
- Host Inventory
- Modules
- Connection Plugins

WHY ANSIBLE?
- Has predifined modules/functionalities.
- Ansible scripts are basically yml based.
- Ansible modules are idem potent.(Configuration is already done means you can use same script for configuration)
- Push based (No need of agent)


1) HOST INVENTORY : 
- Ansible's inventory hosts file is used to list and group your servers. 
- Its default location is /etc/ansible/hosts.
- Static Inventory: It's a file in which we can maintain host/group details manually.
- Dynamic Inventory: It's a script which will fetch host details dynamically from external resources from cloud providers.

SOME IMPORTANT POINTS IN INVENTORY FILE.
- Comments begin with the '#' character
- Blank lines are ignored
- Groups of hosts are delimited by [header] elements
- You can enter hostnames or ip addresses
- A hostname/ip can be a member of multiple groups
- Ungrouped hosts are specifying before any group headers, like below



- CONNECTION PLUGINS:
		SSH
		WINRM


2) PLAYBOOKS: 
- Playbook is a single YAML file, containing one or more ‘plays/tasks’ in a list.
- Plays are ordered sets of tasks to execute against host servers from your inventory file.
- Play defines a set of activities (tasks) to be run on hosts.
- Task is an action to be perform on the host.
Examples are 
a) Execute a command
b) Run a shell script
c) Install a package
d) Shutdown/Restart the hosts.
- Playbooks start with the YAML three dashes (---) and end with ...
