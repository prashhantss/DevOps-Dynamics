Configuration of NFS Server

Step 1: Install NFS Kernel Server
Before installing the NFS Kernel server, we need to update our system’s repository index with that of the Internet through the following apt command as sudo:

$ sudo apt-get update

The above command lets us install the latest available version of a software through the Ubuntu repositories.

Now, run the following command in order to install the NFS Kernel Server on your system:

$ sudo apt install nfs-kernel-server


Step 2: Create the Export Directory

sudo mkdir -p /mnt/share/

# As we want all clients to access the directory, we will remove restrictive permissions.
sudo chown nobody:nogroup /mnt/share/
sudo chmod 777 /mnt/share/

Step 3: Assign server access to client(s) through NFS export file

sudo vi /etc/exports


#/mnt/share/ <clientIP or Clients CIDR>(rw,sync,no_subtree_check,no_root_squash)
 #Ex:
/mnt/share/ *(rw,sync,no_subtree_check,no_root_squash)




Step 4: Export the shared directory

$ sudo exportfs -a



sudo systemctl restart nfs-kernel-server

Step 5: Open firewall for the client (s) PORT 2049




Configuring the Client Machine


Step 1: Install NFS Common
Before installing the NFS Common application, we need to update our system’s repository index with that of the Internet through the following apt command as sudo:

$ sudo apt-get update


$ sudo apt-get install nfs-common
